2. Linked Data for a five year old 

First of all I should explain you, what the World Wide Web is. So when your "Mum" is sitting in front of the computer, she is probably using the World Wide Web. The world Wide Web contains hundred of billion pages. This pages were uploaded from people all over the world, as the name is saying. The pages contain informations, descriptions about a specific themes or even pictures and graphs. 
At the end the World Wide Web ist a network of computers, which are connected and they share the uploaded information with everybody, doesn't matter where you live. You don't know what a network is? 
A network is a group of interconnected people. For example your school class is a network as well. In this case the computers are the network. 

The pages on the world wide web is for everybody. It is very useful to share the knowledge with everybody, it is a big advantage for everybody when they find a lot of information about one topic in a short time. 
Let's say your "Mum" is looking for information about "Children Birthday Games, because she is organizing a Birthday Party for you. She wants to find as much information as possible. How is this going? 
So the people from all over the world put information on the World Wide Web with different Children Birthday Games and your Mum is finding them with one "Klick". 

Now you have to imaging that computers are not thinking the same way as we do. Computers are not very smart. A computer needs an instruction for every step. When he doesn't get any instructions he doesn't know that he has to do. For getting as much information together as possible (that your "Mum" can organise the best Birthday Party ever) the information about "Children Birthay Games" have to be linked together.
Linked means connected together. Linked Data is a method to improve the infromation finding on the World Wide Web. The best informations about "Children Birthday Games" are linked together and for your "Mum" it's going to be easy, organizing your Birthday Party. Because the different infromation are linked together, they have a relationship togehter.
